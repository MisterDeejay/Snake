# Snake
This is remake of the Nokia classic Snake game. Begin playing with the arrows or W, A, S, D keys as the gamepad. Use them to turn the snake in the direction of the snake's next meal and watch her grow after consuming each meal. Click the toggle walls option to allow the snake to wrap through the walls when playing.
